# Beta Climbs

## Inspiration
Me and my friend Arabel love to climb together. For this project, we took our climbing joys as our main inspiration for creating **Beta Climbs**.

## What It Does
Beta Climbs offers several features, including:
- **AI Scan for Rock Climb Holds:** Automatically detect and classify climbing holds using advanced image processing.
- **AI Route Planning Suggestions:** Get intelligent recommendations for your climbing routes.
- **Login Authentication:** Secure user sign in.
- **Real Working Backend:** Fetch and store user data, images, and more.
- **Real-Time Data Collection and Script Execution:** Dynamic functionality powered by Python scripts.
- **Multiple Screens:** Navigate through 8+ screens such as Home, Club, Add, Leaderboard, You, Login, etc.
- **Rock Wall Problem Classification:** Analyze and classify climbing problems.

## How We Built It
- **Frontend:** Built with React Native and Expo.
- **Backend:** Powered by Firebase.
- **Scripting & AI:** Python is used for script execution and image processing.

## Challenges We Ran Into
- The Expo camera was very unreliable, so we had to switch to file uploads.
- Time constraints made development challenging.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- Finishing the project.
- Implementing AI and image scanning.

## What We Learned
- Time management.
- The importance of perseverance and continuous grinding.

## What's Next for Beta Climbs
- Continue development to polish design and backend code.
- Potential launch on the App Store.
- Further refine AI functionalities and user experience.
